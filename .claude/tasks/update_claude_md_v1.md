# Update CLAUDE.md with Skills Integration and YS Studio Artifacts Info

## Objective
Update the project CLAUDE.md file to include Claude Skills integration and align with the YS Studio Artifacts project structure.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Project Overview Section
- Include YS Studio Artifacts description
- Define the multi-tool repository nature
- Emphasize standalone, zero-dependency approach

### 2. Integrate Claude Skills System
- Document the 4 active skills:
  - ascii-interpreter: For ASCII art algorithms
  - webapp-testing: For automated testing
  - git-commit-helper: For intelligent commits
  - artifacts-builder: For HTML artifact creation
- Define when to use each skill
- Include proper skill invocation examples

### 3. Update File Creation Guidelines
- Emphasize HTML/CSS/JavaScript for tools (not TypeScript)
- Maintain zero-dependency principle
- Add tool-specific directory structure

### 4. Add Tool Development Workflow
- Define process for creating new tools
- Include testing requirements
- Document deployment considerations

### 5. Maintain Existing Workflow
- Keep the proven task management system
- Preserve session context management
- Retain approval workflow

## Rationale
- The current CLAUDE.md lacks project-specific context
- Skills system integration will improve development efficiency
- Clear guidelines for HTML tool development are needed
- Existing workflow has proven effective and should be preserved

## Tasks Breakdown
1. Add YS Studio Artifacts project overview section
2. Document Claude Skills integration with examples
3. Update file creation guidelines for HTML tools
4. Add tool development workflow section
5. Review and ensure consistency throughout document

## Success Criteria
- Skills are properly documented with usage examples
- Project context is clear and comprehensive
- HTML tool development guidelines are explicit
- Existing workflow remains intact and enhanced
